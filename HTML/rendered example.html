<b>Darwin: </b><I>Hi, all this is Darwin gross with the inaugural episode of the Art Music Tech podcast. In this one we talked to Sim, Turkish <span style="color:red" data-ts="9.99" data-end_ts="10.29" title="9.99" id=c_"9.99">__***<inaudible>***__</span> who is a developer for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cycling_%2774">Cycling '74</a>. And Ah, his particular baby is the mirror iPad app, which is a pretty awesome way to interface with your, Max Patch. But we talk about a lot more than just that. We talk about, his background, some of his work with different devices and, in kind of a, a shot off the bow. We also talk about his predilection to travel all over the world and live in various places as a way of sort of like personal interaction with the world. So it's my first podcast. I sound like I'm on drugs, but I was in fact just not sure of how to speak into <span style="color:red" data-ts="57.7" data-end_ts="57.79" title="57.7" id=c_"57.7">__a__</span> microphone. So, give me a break on that one. But, so I hope you enjoy this interview and the many more to come. Okay. Sam, it's great to have you, come visit our little podcast here. <span style="color:red" data-ts="76.31" data-end_ts="76.51" title="76.31" id=c_"76.31">__Ah__</span>, right now you are kind of in the spotlight because of the recent release of Muira, the iPad app that interfaces with your Max UI. Clearly this is a big sea change for people that are used to working with Max. Could you tell me a little bit of how you view what you view as the most important aspect of, the availability of mirror? 
</p>

</I><p>
<b>Sam Tarakajian: </b>Wow. That, there's, there's so much in that question. I, don't know quite how to, reaction <span style="color:red" data-ts="105.29" data-end_ts="105.43" title="105.29" id=c_"105.29">__at__</span> least of which is this in the spotlight business. But that's, that's here, there. Way back in the day mirror kind of grew out of this, thing that I was interested in. I was really super interested in kind of gesture and in using, accelerometer data and this kind of stuff to make music and intuitive work actually did a thesis project <span style="color:red" data-ts="128.12" data-end_ts="128.41" title="128.12" id=c_"128.12">__actually__</span>. And there's actually a video of me demonstrating it by flailing, pretty adoringly, on the Internet that if you, if you want to chuckle, you should go check out. But the point is that what you would do is define, <span style="color:red" data-ts="140.62" data-end_ts="140.72" title="140.62" id=c_"140.62">__the__</span> defined kind of modalities and gesture by dragging together a little objects on your phone in the same way that you would use, react table. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>And for me that was always where I conceived of Jelly was <span style="color:red" data-ts="153.8" data-end_ts="154.03" title="153.8" id=c_"153.8">__as__</span> a mirror I should say, which was going to be this thing that would bring the kind of affordances of gesture and real world modal stuff into <span style="color:red" data-ts="164.07" data-end_ts="164.61" title="164.07" id=c_"164.07">__macs__</span> in a really easy and intuitive way that <span style="color:red" data-ts="167.95" data-end_ts="168.12" title="167.95" id=c_"167.95">__is__</span> more useful for is this, this is more useful for is defining these interfaces and empowers you to make interfaces that you wouldn't have made otherwise and control things that you wouldn't have thought to control otherwise. And Max I think has always been about that in terms of what you get to play with. You don't get to play with clips and timelines and tempo. Tempe, I guess some key <span style="color:red" data-ts="196.42" data-end_ts="196.91" title="196.42" id=c_"196.42">__signatures__</span>. You know, you get to play with patch cords and objects and samples and clips. And so the salad you get in access always been very distinctive. And I'm hoping that mural bring that same thing to the domain of interactivity. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><I>Yeah, that's actually pretty interesting that that's approach that you take on it. We're on the Internet. Can we see you like flinging an iPhone or iPad around? 
</p>

</I><p>
<b>Sam: </b>You can, it's on my youtube channel, which is, dude, eight three, seven. Which is my internet handle from way back in the day when AOL chat rooms were a thing. And the project is called <span style="color:red" data-ts="230.41" data-end_ts="230.85" title="230.41" id=c_"230.41">__***<inaudible>***__</span>, spelled g. E. L. I. E. M. Yeah, that's what all the stuff was. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><I>One of the things that I found when I used, when I use mirror is that I initially start off doing a user interface that feels very much like what I would have on screen with my Max thing. But I ended up making adjustments to it first of all, to sort of like match the size of my fingers or where I like my fingers to lie on the face of the eye. iPad for example. And I start becoming a lot more aware of like the physical layout of things. Was that something that, that you experienced as well? Or, or did you find yourself moving or wanting to more use things like the accelerometer data and stuff like that? What did she personally find more compelling? 
</p>

</I><p>
<b>Sam: </b>In my gut of guts, the accelerometer is always going to be, this kind of stuff is always going to be the most, interesting because when it comes time to perform, those are for me the most fun sensors to play around with are touch <span style="color:red" data-ts="292.15" data-end_ts="292.53" title="292.15" id=c_"292.15">__screens__</span>, sensors that are kind of loose and the pronged like the multitouch object and the accelerometers stuff. These are the most fun things to play around with. But when I, when I'm using neuro, I find myself in a very similar position to, I think the one you're describing. And it's really interesting actually how different the experience of building an interface is when everything is immediately synchronized and immediately reactive. There are other apps that let you build interfaces, but I think because the process of building the interface and, listening to how it makes sound are so decoupled, what ends up happening is you sort of build interfaces that look like interfaces you've seen before. And then, later <span style="color:red" data-ts="338.02" data-end_ts="338.11" title="338.02" id=c_"338.02">__in__</span> an offline process, connect those up to the sounds that you want to, control. And I think in, in mirror different kinds of things starts, at least in my experience, something different happens because it's right there. And because, the choices that you make are reflected immediately. There's kind of this convergent evolution between the sounds that you're making, the interface you design that might be better. It might just be different. I Dunno, it is at least, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><I>different now. One of the things that's interesting as you describe it too is that that there actually is almost like two paradigms at work here. There's, there's like one that's, that's playful and one that's productive by laying out a user interface that is immediately assessable in, in, in very much, an efficient way to touch the patch. You're, you're being very productive. But at the same time, the things like the multi-packs in particular of the <span style="color:red" data-ts="393.25" data-end_ts="393.55" title="393.25" id=c_"393.25">__cell__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="393.55" data-end_ts="393.91" title="393.55" id=c_"393.55">__Ramad__</span> at data opens up doors for a little more playful performance type environment. 
</p>

</I><p>
<b>Sam: </b>Yeah. And, I think it's interesting that this distinction between politically being productive and being playful, it's a really, tricky distinction to make, isn't it? Because especially I feel like, composition today as a very different take, a very different feel from composition, I dunno, a hundred years ago say, in large focus because of this, offline versus immediate feedback. You know, at one point in time you have to memorize the sounds of blood, of a lot of different instruments in different combinations from many different historical samples and composition was about kind of recalling all those memories and all those illusions and arranging them and then months later hoping that the sound was what you'd kind of imagined. Whereas now I feel like competition almost is play. It seems like competition for me anyway, is often about putting a bunch of sounds in a player and listening to them and then refining kind of through this productive play, I guess, towards something that ends up being a final composition. And I think it's interesting that, you know, interface building interfaces was, well, in any case, it definitely does. Mark a division between interfaces that you'd have to build and then connect versus the kind that you can actually build in that playful, productive way that I think more mirrors the style of composition that, is kind of invoked with the way music is produced today. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><I>Right. Well, especially if you kind of extend the paradigm, what you're, what we're really talking about is people kind of making like a personal protocol to interface with their personal instrument. I mean, it's also easy syncratic but that's what people seem to really be embracing about. What's happening right now is this, the ability to make a very peculiar and personal thing. And I think that that's one of the things that, at least in my work with mirror, I, I've been really excited about is the ability to make something that really feels, it feels like an extension of me. And, as you suggest, because I'm sort of like developing this on the fly, it ends up being a little less, the interface design ends up not disconnected from the play of this new instrument that I've made for myself. 
</p>

</I><p>
<b>Sam: </b>Yeah. I only wish somehow that, that, I, I don't know that it's necessary, but I would love to figure out a way to bring that, that personal, the person, personal connection that you're talking about to bring that out into a performance cause you know, you can see the screen when you're interfacing with this, device and it is the interface that you built and it does lend a personal touch to, the soundscape that you're controlling. But, there must be some way to take that and extend it out into the domain of performance where you can also make a performance that's unique and personal, based around the <span style="color:red" data-ts="583.16" data-end_ts="583.61" title="583.16" id=c_"583.16">__***<inaudible>***__</span> itself. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><I>Yeah, that's a, that's a cool idea. The, the only thing I wonder sometimes in, in APL some ideas about this is to what extent the thing that's fascinating for the creator is not necessarily interesting to the viewer. Yeah. You know, I mean, there's nothing worse than watching somebody actually use logic to create a great song. Yeah. And, you know, I wonder if there would be any kind of an enjoyable activity and being involved in, in the viewing of <span style="color:red" data-ts="616.08" data-end_ts="616.21" title="616.08" id=c_"616.08">__the__</span> center interface creation if you were intimately involved in, in making it somehow. 
</p>

</I><p>
<b>Sam: </b>Yeah. I don't know. It's funny, I, I used to, I in college I, I ruined with, this kid who was, was really into starcraft. We've watched these, Korean starcraft videos and it's a real, apparently there's at least a, a large file in case case. Not everyone in the world is familiar with starcraft. It's this computer game that's, reasonably popular in the world, but I guess massively popular in Korea. And they had these like tournaments where people actually show up and watch these guys play this computer game and what's in <span style="color:red" data-ts="657.33" data-end_ts="657.67" title="657.33" id=c_"657.33">__pencils__</span>. It's this whole stadium full of people watching these two guys play and they look exactly like people checking their email. You know what I mean? You're in the stadium watching these two guys just kind of check their email. But are you talking about like 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><I>20,000 Person Stadium? 
</p>

</I><p>
<b>Sam: </b>Oh yeah. I mean, I don't know if it's 20,000, <span style="color:red" data-ts="674.98" data-end_ts="675.1" title="674.98" id=c_"674.98">__but__</span> easily two or 3000 people in a maybe stadium as a exaggeration, I'm <span style="color:red" data-ts="681.11" data-end_ts="681.24" title="681.11" id=c_"681.11">__going__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="681.3" data-end_ts="681.43" title="681.3" id=c_"681.3">__to__</span> <span style="color:red" data-ts="681.43" data-end_ts="681.54" title="681.43" id=c_"681.43">__do__</span> scary vision. It's pretty crazy. And they're really, they're a lot of fun to watch. Even if you don't speak arena, don't give a, you know, don't care about 'em starcraft, they're still really entertaining. But yeah, it's like you watch these guys playing and they, they themselves are not that, compelling, but then you look at their hands and you look at what they're doing and it is kind of overwhelming. Like they move really quick. And I think the same is probably true of someone making music, like to watch him play with logic on stage is not that exciting. But if you've ever watched a tutorial or watch someone like maybe over someone's shoulder while they work with logic, especially if you yourself have worked with logic, it can be really impressive. But the thing is that it is impressive, not performative. Right? I guess that's sort of what you're getting at. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><I>Well, you know, you don't actually, maybe a parallel. That makes sense. I, one of my eight like crazy passions is on doing the modular synth synthesizer thing. And I actually use do that in performance. How we start with like a blank, a blank synth. And I just start patching. So people are like engaged in the idea of everything they're hearing, I'm having to make on the spot. And of course they see the big sweat rings around my arms and stuff and pretty quickly get a sense that you see I guess, but they're there, you know, they're actually seeing me have, have to work. 
</p>

</I><p>
<b>Sam: </b>Right. Do you do anything, is there anything beyond, just like, I mean obviously you're working very hard to, to patch this thing together and to have it make a cool sound and that shows for part of the performance. Is there any, are you aware of kind of the, the burden, but I guess the, the opportunity to be, to be performative in that, in that context? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><I>Oh, absolutely. But a big part of it too is that it's very clear that it's risky. And I always see like, I feel like that that's, that's one of the things that actually separates what I consider a performance from a presentation. I feel like a lot of times when I go see people do music or do a live show, what I'm actually seeing as a presentation of their work. It reminds me like of the old bays where a guy would stand up at the front of stage and turn on a tape recorder where this thing he labored over for nine months will now play. And that that was, that was never anything that resonated with anyone, you know. But, it, by seeing and sensing the risk and hearing me lay some clams out there occasionally, it actually, provides people with the, with the sense that they're really involved in the performance and they're seeing something that's unique. It's never going to be the same. And in fact, I'm, you know, I'm, I'm putting it out there. And so there's a certain amount of performance that just comes from being, from doing the tight rope walk. I think, well, we just talked about what I do for, for a performance. What can a performance work do you do? 
</p>

</I><p>
<b>Sam: </b>Yeah, I, I haven't been doing, so much performance work lately, which is frustrating because it is something that I really enjoy. But it's interesting we're talking about, performance, because it is kind of crazy how much, in spite of the fact that so much technology has, has come into existence around making music and to the point where it becomes, you know, you give this example of a guy go from pushing play and having a performance happen, it's that easy to make a huge amount of music. But at the same time for <span style="color:red" data-ts="893.97" data-end_ts="894.12" title="893.97" id=c_"893.97">__two__</span> reason, it means that there is all this hardware associated with making music. And when you go to perform, you're behind this, you know, enormous, rig and you, yourself, the performer can be like really reduced to this, like, you know, guy with the head and one arm that once in a while becomes a fist in the air. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>That's, you know, that's the entirety of what you have to present. And that's, a little bit frustrating and a big, something I'm really interested in with, with Mira is getting to move out from behind that, rig and actually engage and like my dream is to, have this wearable iPad thing. You could walk through a performance and have this, very body oriented, experience. Like going back to the original gesture based music controller that, I was building as a doe-eyed college junior. The idea was always to, you know, bring <span style="color:red" data-ts="953.46" data-end_ts="953.54" title="953.46" id=c_"953.46">__me__</span> into performance embodied again and to bring it out into the, into what let's, let's call maybe participants rather than, than audience members. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><I>Well that'd be pretty, pretty awesome. But you know, it's funny you say you don't, you don't do performance because, I think one of the ways that you engage in a performance is through the, the work that you do on Youtube in, under your nude eight, three, seven monitor. I mean the, it's really interesting to me the way that you sort of like treat the development of, of the patch, not as like training material but more as a performance that people would be able to, engage with in a different way. How did you decide to do things that way? And 
</p>

</I><p>
<b>Sam: </b>it's a, it's incredibly amusing to me that you call that, that work. For two reasons. One because, it's a, that that's attaches an era of gravitas that, given the fraction of those tutorials that are made, that are not made sober, that level of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1023.98" data-end_ts="1024.46" title="1023.98" id=c_"1023.98">__***<inaudible>***__</span> probably should not be attached to it. The other is that there zero work. I mean, the, the how I got started making those was, being a little bit bored and having just found this, karplus strong algorithm and how to do it in Max and just being excited to talk about it. And the thing is that's nice about youtube is that, yeah, sometimes I feel more excited about teaching or explaining or talking about something than the person I'm talking to is interested in listening. But the cool thing about youtube is you can just assume the other person is listening and just not shut up. And for me not having to shut up actually was a very enjoyable experience. And that made it very, very easy to make a whole bunch of these, really fast. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><I>So this is like one form of teaching. What kind of other teaching stuff do you do? Do you do, do you ever do like one on ones or do you ever do like workshop type teaching? 
</p>

</I><p>
<b>Sam: </b>I do, workshop type things as often as I can. And I really, last last summer I was traveling a bit. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1097.74" data-end_ts="1097.86" title="1097.74" id=c_"1097.74">__Then__</span> I tried to do as many workshops as I could in, in different schools, in different, countries in different contexts. And that's a ton of fun. I love to do max workshops and some of the reason that that the workshop to burn the tutorials is, it's a very different, it's, it's super challenging. Ah, there's such a, you learn a lot really fast. Like you got a whole bunch of preconceived notions going in things like, oh, it's, it's really important for me to nail these concepts. And, and what I've kind of realized is that a, it's, it's not that important to actually be technically correct ever. And, don't, don't tell anyone that is planning on coming to a workshop and, and a B that there is a temptation in the context of, of a workshop or something like that to, kind of demonstrate one's own knowledge in instead of really focusing on it. It's there and, and, and you don't even realize it's there at first, but, a couple of bad workshops can teach you really quick that, that, it's, you know, it's important to be mindful of that and to, to, 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><I>so, you know, knock on that track. 
</p>

</I><p>
<b>Sam: </b>What I, what I find in workshops actually is that, the big difference is that when you're teaching, in a tutorial for example, I guess because people can go back and view the information and because, there are shorter, you can be more technically precise and what you're really trying to teach is something technical. But I think in the context of a workshop e the technical details don't really matter at all. I feel like you're trying to teach, you know, like the tutorial might teach the nuts and bolts of how to use Max in a workshop. Teachers maybe like how to have fun with like, what's fun about it, how to have fun with it, how to view the world in a way that will allow you to use mass to have fun. I think that's the most important thing you can teach in, in the actual workshop setting. I have tried doing, sorry, but I have tried doing some like one-on-one, private lessons with backs and that's something that I definitely have not figured out. And it's very strange. It's re, I don't know. Have you ever tried doing that? You 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><I>know, I, I've tried a couple of times in what it, what it always ends up happening is it either ends up being, that they want to do something that they saw me do or there is some sort of, they expect me to reveal a trick that isn't displayed anywhere. You know, they expect me to like reveal this, the super secret Max. I don't know the secret ring, the contents of the secret ring, which is a makes everything work cool. Right. And then when I say, well, yeah, you know, the frame rate's going to be kind of crappy if you do this or you know, if you do too much of this, you're going to just overload the signal channel and they kind of blink and look at me disappointingly as if, oh, this is where I thought the good stuff was going to come. 
</p>

</I><p>
<b>Sam: </b>Right. Yeah. Yeah. I just, it's weird because like it is musical and this is what made me think, oh, sure. Music, it'll be just like a piano lesson. But, yeah, it just did not, did not work that way. There was not that vibe at all. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><I>Interesting. Ah, one of the things you said is that, as part of traveling, you did a bunch of teaching him practically any time I find out about what you're doing, you're actually physically in a different place. So right now you're in Germany, right? That's right. Just not that long ago. You were, I think in New York for awhile and you're on the west coast for awhile. You kind of bop around a lot. How do you, what do you find difficult about that? I mean, one of the things that I like about being kind of in one place is that I develop a rapport with the whole local community and stuff like that. How does moving a lot, how is that a challenge with, or your identity as a, as a, as an artist. And conversely, how does that open up interesting doors for you? 
</p>

</I><p>
<b>Sam: </b>That's a good question. I was, hoping that you were born to ask whether it was, difficult to, to move around a lot. And, I mean the answer to that question is gonna be easy. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1357.34" data-end_ts="1357.41" title="1357.34" id=c_"1357.34">__So__</span> I mean, no, I mean I'm, I'm or why I was hoping you were going to ask why I was choosing to move around so much in the answer to that. It's easy. It's because I'm from New Jersey and it's always been, the focus has always been about, going to other places besides New Jersey. That's kind of like the, that's been the, that's been like the tradition, you know, I grew up in Howard. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1381.52" data-end_ts="1381.71" title="1381.52" id=c_"1381.52">__Those__</span>, it is really tricky. And the hardest thing is like you said, that when you are in one place for a long time, you do sink. You know, your roots can sink really deep into the people around me ran into the, community or India. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>But the thing that is really interesting for me is, I don't know how to describe it. I'm really just addicted. I'm basically, <span style="color:red" data-ts="1406.27" data-end_ts="1406.33" title="1406.27" id=c_"1406.27">__I'm__</span> just addicted to this thing that happens when you travel and you go someplace else and you see something new is you see, it violates assumptions that you kind of have about, life. And the way, it shouldn't be that, I mean, I remember once I, at the summer camp, it was, doing a camp counselor at <span style="color:red" data-ts="1429.68" data-end_ts="1429.73" title="1429.68" id=c_"1429.68">__the__</span> summer camp and we were taking a bunch of kids out into the woods, to get some, some firewood, you know, there's a tree and I broke a branch off this tree to collect it to make the firewood and this, and this kid is, this kid looks up at me and he's like, he's slack-jawed. And I'm like, what is it? 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>What's wrong? And he looks at me having just broken this branch off the tree. And he goes, you can do that. And it had just never, I mean, I guess like all his life, his parents had been like, don't fuck with the trees in the park or whatever. Like, you know, don't walk into the woods, don't whatever. And you just seeing for the first time that you, you know, you could go into the forest and just break branches off trees. You could just do that. You know, Amanda, the world is crazy. And it was like, it was just funny to me because it was here. It was this, I don't know, this is a very innocent experience with is very, I was just seeing this kid learned that what he thought was kind of this, rural that you take for granted was not actually true in that for me over and over again has been the experience of going to different parts of the world, seeing how people live and what they, in Berlin for example, it turns out that sleep is not something that's necessary and, you don't actually have to charge money for beer. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>These are kind of the things that I'm learning. The rules that I thought were you should take for granted, but it turns out are not actually that important to have a stable society. But the other part, which is, forming connections with people. I had a really, uncomfortable realization. You're the day when I was thinking about where home is, where in <span style="color:red" data-ts="1528.68" data-end_ts="1528.99" title="1528.68" id=c_"1528.68">__***<inaudible>***__</span> feels a lot like home. And what I've kind of started to realize is that, it's not jersey, it's not the west coast. It's not anywhere else that I've been. It's actually any place that I can open up and start charging my laptop is actually the place that is home. I think home is this, big piece of aluminum that I carry around in my backpack. As strange as that is and what exactly that means and whether or not that's something that I should be comfortable with is, very much a subject for debate. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>And I don't have a good answer to that question. So where are you going to go next after <span style="color:red" data-ts="1564.61" data-end_ts="1564.96" title="1564.61" id=c_"1564.61">__Berlin__</span>? Where's after Balloon Berlin? I been talking to usually the way that I decided to go. Some places I'll get in touch with someone, someone I, I just, got in touch with someone who's in, Barcelona and thinks they might know of, someone who's willing to host a Max workshop. So I may, I may go there. And, I also learned just recently that there was a, a hackerspace that's just opened up in Yerevan. Eurobond is the capital of Armenia and based on when I was there based on the number of power outages per day that, we're in effect the last time I was there. And the fact that I think, I don't know this is true, but I think, I think when our, I've been allowed to drive only as recently as like 10 or 15 years ago. These two things taken together make it very hard for me to believe that there's a hacker space there. So, I dunno, I guess I'm very interested in going and seeing, what exactly that, what exactly hackerspace means in, the Armenian capital. So these are the two places I guess I have in mind in the near future. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><I>Yeah, that sounds really interesting. I guess, you know, when you imagine a hackerspace, you imagine like, you know, somewhere in San Francisco where those 10 zillion people and circuitry falling from the sky and it's, it's, it is hard to imagine what it could be like, although I have to admit so often. I make assumptions about place and then I get there and I realized while the people are just as incredibly charged this everywhere else and they find a way, you know, everyone finds a way. Yeah. So you kind of keep track of, certain kinds of trends. What are, what are some trends that you think are going to be happening sort of in the media, art, music, visual arts kind of world, the the web connected art world. What are, what are things that you see that you think are really important? 
</p>

</I><p>
<b>Sam: </b>I haven't arranged everything into a big schema yet, so that, they just have noted a couple of little, the biggest thing that I think is interesting and a little tremble is the degree to which it's possible now. So for, for a long time it was very easy to other things that you would sell. The things that people would buy were artifacts that were functional or pretty, you know, you'd sell a piece of artwork or you would sell, a dishwasher that would wash your dishes and whether or not you buy it was kind of dependent on how well <span style="color:red" data-ts="1730.39" data-end_ts="1730.46" title="1730.39" id=c_"1730.39">__they__</span>, that function. But now with, software and hardware, you can sell things that actually will, will respond to you and you can sell things that will create experiences for you. And where this pops up, it's interesting in the context of media art is you can sell things like, I don't want to name names, but native instruments for example, I think, sells a lot of software based on the idea that once you buy this thing, it's going to enable you to sound a certain way. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>And it's kind of aspirational, right? It's like you'll buy this no sound like this guy will be able to make music that reminds you of the music that you like. Music that, you know, people around if you will like it. I guess that's always been around. But I dunno, I, I do, I do worry a little bit that software makes it software makes it very easy to sell <span style="color:red" data-ts="1783.75" data-end_ts="1783.93" title="1783.75" id=c_"1783.75">__them__</span>. <span style="color:red" data-ts="1784.01" data-end_ts="1784.15" title="1784.01" id=c_"1784.01">__I__</span> that and that a culture that's moving towards, kind of needing to feel very, quick gratification with, with the things that you get, makes that all the more risky at the same time. I see people like, I really like the work of artists like Dido Manabe. On <span style="color:red" data-ts="1806.26" data-end_ts="1806.48" title="1806.26" id=c_"1806.26">__Mon__</span>, on Ebay, I dunno, more material then in case he's a, this Japanese artist too I think <span style="color:red" data-ts="1811.38" data-end_ts="1811.49" title="1811.38" id=c_"1811.38">__is__</span> big. And the Max, Japanese Max users group, whatever community, who has this really cool approach to working with the digital and software artifacts of the world. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>Is one video that's really cool that you should definitely go check out. He's got a bunch of, this friend spaces with electrodes wild up to them. And he has, explaining that song and I'm assuming that <span style="color:red" data-ts="1835.94" data-end_ts="1836.55" title="1835.94" id=c_"1835.94">__***<inaudible>***__</span> is driving some kind of <span style="color:red" data-ts="1839.25" data-end_ts="1839.57" title="1839.25" id=c_"1839.25">__protocol__</span>, some kind of a microprocessor that sending, electric shocks to his friends' faces. So his friend's faces are all witching kind of in time to the music. It's, I love it because for two reasons. One, because, he retains this, this playfulness with all of the sort of imposing technological tools that surround us, like something that, jolts your skin that enforces your muscles to contract has a certain amount of understandably as a certain amount of what intensity or, or danger associated with it. But he makes it into this kind of cute if a little bit uncomfortable toy. And the other thing that's really cool is that everything that he does, I feel like the wires are just visible enough that it all looks, appropriate wall at every stage. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>And what he does, it feels like, to me at least, you could step in and with some elbow grease kind of figured out what's going on. And it's, it's inspirational in the context of being able to make stuff on your own. So I don't know, I guess on the one hand you have software that's, kind of economics combined with software that's leading to basically aping things that are already established, musical trends for profit, which is not so great familiar and <span style="color:red" data-ts="1913.87" data-end_ts="1913.95" title="1913.87" id=c_"1913.87">__we__</span> have, mass availability of, open source stuff, mass availability of cheap hardware and software and presence of charismatic figures like <span style="color:red" data-ts="1925.02" data-end_ts="1925.28" title="1925.02" id=c_"1925.02">__Di__</span> Tohu show us how to do really fun stuff with it. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><I>Talking about, talking about sort of like the, you know, buy a piece of software that allows you to be, become a certain thing. You're right in that it's always been the case. But for example, when I was young now it's like you'd see led Zeppelin play and dudes playing a Les Paul Guitar and I could go out and get a leg swelled guitar, but that didn't mean that I was, you know, that guy. It was disappointing for a lot of people because they, they weren't able to get into it. I, I don't know, there seems to be like a, a line of that should be held that somehow we can't identify yet because it's, it is actually really nice to be able to get the Berlin house construction kit and have some success 20 minutes after you bought it. There seems to also be something missing in that process. 
</p>

</I><p>
<b>Sam: </b>Djs and Djs were the first people I feel like to really get upset about this. Right. I feel like it'd be the first instance of this tension was when you had software that could be matched for you. Do you know what I mean? I feel like that was the first time that somebody said, hey, wait a second. That's what cheating or you know, that's not, it's not the same. Anybody can do that. What I do is actually technical and difficult and I didn't just break out the Berlin house software kit and instantly sound acceptable. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><I>To what extent do you think it's important to sort of see the wires hanging out? The backside of the thing 
</p>

</I><p>
<b>Sam: </b>depends on the art, <span style="color:red" data-ts="2022.76" data-end_ts="2023.15" title="2022.76" id=c_"2022.76">__Edmunds__</span> in the art and depends on what you're trying to say. If, if what you want to do is, to some extent the things that Dido does, the finish projects can actually be very, very produced. One thing that he does that I really like, I both really relate to and really like is he posts, he's a very active youtube channel. He posts a lot of content as he's making it. So when you actually do finally see the finished result, you can go back and, or maybe you like me, I've been watching every week he'll post a new video or he's built a different laser pointing out that, you know, works or doesn't work to varying degrees. And what's cool about that actually is that when you do see that final work, the robots not breaking a sweat like you are when you're patching, but you know that it could break literally because you'd seen it break and you know, videos for weeks now. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Sam: </b>So I hadn't thought about that until just this moment, but maybe that does make the final work more compelling because you can see the robot sweat. <span style="color:red" data-ts="2087.45" data-end_ts="2087.57" title="2087.45" id=c_"2087.45">__Maybe__</span> you know what robot sweat looks like. I guess I'm reminded of the fact that, I have a lot of friends who are dancers and, wanting to take new seat dance shows and I have a very hard time getting into dance. And, I think it's because of, in spite of the fact that I have a tremendous enthusiasm for dancing, I am as the historical record will show very, very bad at it. But, but what I'm, what I'm getting at is that, I think when you go to see dance, I think it's not for nothing that the friends of mine who enjoy watching it are also doers of it. I think that the kind of a mirror neurons and that kind of stuff that must, fire and must participate when you watch something that your self can do, can be a big part of actually enjoying <span style="color:red" data-ts="2137.51" data-end_ts="2137.61" title="2137.51" id=c_"2137.51">__that__</span> performance. And I have no doubt that I'm seeing the wires, speaks much more strongly to a community who also has worked with wires, if that makes sense. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><I>Right, absolutely. 
</p>

</I><p>
<b>Sam: </b>For the exact same reasons that I, I can't really watch dance. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><I>Right. Well, Sam, thank you so much for spending the time talking with me. 
</p>

</I><p>
<b>Sam: </b>Hey man, it's been a delight. Thank you so much. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Darwin: </b><I>Yeah. And we'll see where this takes us, but, I appreciate you taking the time and you've been wellness. Spill your guts a little bit. It was, it was great fun. Bye.
