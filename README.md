# AMT-Transcripts Transcription App

Transcriptions for the AMT Podcast are completed using the [https://rev.ai](https://rev.ai) service, which produces a JSON file with timestamp, punctuation, spacing and timing for every word in the transcribed document. But like all auto-transcribing tools, it misses a lot of stuff. For example, MIDI is often transcribed as "mini", or "Mitty" or even "Mindy". So it still have to be cleaned up manually.

The tr-parse application runs through the JSON document, ID's poorly transcribed words, labels the speaker, formats things into manageable HTML paragraphs, and installs some boilerplate around the HTML. It also, optionally, can create a document that provides direct access to the audio file for verification of the words (which is proving to be a great timesaver).

Huge thanks to Bernhard Wagner, who took a minimal Node.js program and is turning it into a powerhouse!

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up on your local machine for cleaning up automatic transcriptions.

### Prerequisites

```bash
git clone https://github.com/darwingrosse/AMT-Transcripts.git
cd AMT-Transcripts/App
npm install
```

## Invoking the program
```bash
cd AMT-Transcripts/App
./tr-parse.js --help

tr-parse.js <json>

generate plain html from json, filtering out cruft

Commands:
  tr-parse.js plain <json>  generate plain html from json, filtering out cruft
                                                                       [default]
  tr-parse.js audio <json>  generate html with audio support

Positionals:
  json  the json file as found in the ../JSON/ directory

Options:
  --version           Show version number                              [boolean]
  --speakers, -s      speakers                                [array] [required]
  --release-date, -r  release date, e.g. 'November 25, 2019'          [required]
  --help, -h, -?      Show help                                        [boolean]

./tr-parse.js audio --help

tr-parse.js audio <json>

generate html with audio support

Options:
  --version           Show version number                              [boolean]
  --speakers, -s      speakers                                [array] [required]
  --release-date, -r  release date, e.g. 'November 25, 2019'          [required]
  --help, -h, -?      Show help                                        [boolean]
  --audio-file, -a    audio file
  --audio-offset, -o  audio file offset when speech starts in seconds [float]
                                                                      [required]

                                                                      [required]
```

To generate an HTML file with the ability to play the audio podcast:

```bash
./tr-parse.js audio transcript-0005.json -s Darwin 'Barry Moon' -r 'November 10, 2013' -a path_to_podcast_audio/Podcast_005_BMoon.mp3 -o 6.1
```
* `audio`: This invokes the `audio` subcommand
* `transcript-0005.json`: The name of the json source file.
* `-s`: an array of speakers in order of their appearance (usually two).
* `-r`: release date of the podcast
* `-a`: path to the audio file of the podcast
* `-o`: offset where the spoken word part begins in seconds

**Note**: The audio play/stop interface is minimal: Clicking on a word anywhere starts playing the podcast from that point on. But clicking also toggles between playing and pausing. You'll get the hang of it. You can also toggle play/pause by pressing the space bar. The audio files of the podcast are available [here](http://artmusictech.libsyn.com/). The background of the rendered html file is yellowish when it is connected to the audio podcast. The text with lighter background is clickable and the podcast will be played from there. Also the cursor changes to a hand when hovering above a word from where the podcast can be started.

**Note**: the `audio` subcommand and its options `-a` and `-o` are to be used
only while fixing the transcriptions. When done with fixing, the HTML should
be generated without the `audio` command and its two options,
e.g.:

```bash
./tr-parse.js transcript-0005.json -s Darwin 'Barry Moon' -r November 10, 2013
```

The generated html file will have the same stem as the provided json file but with the
`.html` extension and it will be stored in the `HTML` directory. E.g.
`HTML/transcript-0005.html`
If the `audio` subcommand is used, the generated `html` file will have the same
name with `_audio` appended before the extension, e.g.
`HTML/transcript-0005_audio.html`
The generated `HTML/transcript-0005_audio.html` has a default style to facilitate
distinguishing it from the plain `html`generated when omitting the `audio`
subcommand. The `audio` default style can be overridden by providing a `css` file
named `../HTML/j2h.css`. There's an example file `../HTML/j2h_example.css`.

**Note**: If no audio file is passed via the `-a` option, the `audio`
subcommand will look for an audio file in the folder `../AUDIO` based on the
episode number, e.g.
```bash
./tr-parse.js audio transcript-0005.json -s Darwin 'Barry Moon' -r November 10, 2013 -o 6.1
```
will look for an mp3 file in `../AUDIO/` that has `0005` or `005` in its file name. E.g. for episode
`0005` `Podcast_005_BMoon.mp3` will be found if present in the `../AUDIO/` directory. You need to
populate `../AUDIO/` yourself from the  [art + music + technology podcast](http://artmusictech.libsyn.com).
